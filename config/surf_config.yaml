surf_model:

  propagation:
    # ---- SOUTH (unblocked directions) ----
    # Degrees where swell points directly into Bolinas and is fully exposed.
    south_sweet_spot: [170, 225]     # almost due south swells wrap in clean
    # Near-south angles that still work well but slightly less than perfect.
    south_edges: [150, 240]          # nearby directions with partial exposure

    # ---- WEST (classic wrap) ----
    west_range: [240, 280]           # W to WNW, classic wrapping range
    west_period_mid: 11             # logistic center period where wrapping starts
    west_period_k: 1.0               # steepness of period transition (higher = sharper)
    west_height_mid: 2               # logistic center height for west wrap
    west_height_k: 1.0               # steepness of size contribution
    west_base: 0.35                   # minimum west contribution (small wrap)
    west_bonus: 0.6                  # maximum additional wrap when period+size large
    
    # ---- NW (rare wrap events) ----
    nw_range: [280, 300]             # NW to NNW — heavily blocked normally
    nw_period_mid: 11.0              # Logistic center: is the "unlock" point for Bolinas wrap
    nw_period_k: 0.7                 # Replaces scale: steep enough to favor long periods 
    nw_height_mid: 5.0               # Logistic center: offshore size needed for meaningful wrap
    nw_height_k: 0.5                 # Replaces scale: smooth climb as the ocean gets bigger
    nw_base: 0.05                    # Dropped to 0.05: NW is weaker than West by default
    nw_bonus: 0.45                   # Max possible wrap becomes 0.50 (base + bonus)
    nw_floor: 0.05                   # Minimum fallback

    # ---- BLOCKED ----
    blocked_value: 0.05              # anything outside above ranges = mostly blocked


  # === Nearshore shoaling and energy decay ===
  nearshore:
    base_factor: 0.85         # typical offshore→nearshore shoaling
    min_direction_factor: 0.1 # strong suppression in bad directions
    range_factor: 0.15        # ±15% spread for min/max surf range


  # === Wave energy weight ===
  energy:
    height_exp: 1.2           # height exponent – bigger waves grow faster than linear
    period_exp: 0.3           # period exponent – long period increases power
    swell_saturation: 0.35    # governs how quickly swell score approaches 10


  # === Period multiplier (groundswell vs windswell) ===
  period_multiplier:
    min: 0.3                  # minimum multiplier (short-period wind swell)
    max: 1.2                  # maximum multiplier (long-period groundswell)
    midpoint: 10              # period at midpoint of logistic curve
    steepness: 0.8            # how quickly multiplier transitions around midpoint


  # === Tide scoring ===
  tide:
    optimal_low: -1.0         # ideal tide window lower bound (ft MLLW)
    optimal_high: 3.0         # ideal tide window upper bound
    edge_score: 8.5           # the tide score at the optimal_high and optimal_low edges
    outside_decay: 1.0        # the speed of tide quality dropoff outside the optimal window

  # === Wind categorization ===
  wind:
    offshore_threshold_deg: 45.0   # max angle from offshore to be considered offshore
    onshore_threshold_deg: 135.0   # min angle from offshore to be considered onshore



  # === Final score weightings ===
  weights:
    swell: 0.5                # weight of swell score in final result
    wind: 0.2                 # weight of wind score
    tide: 0.2                 # weight of tide score
    baseline: 10.0             # baseline surf value (small clean surf)
